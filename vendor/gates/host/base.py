"""Host base class — the adapter contract every platform implements.

The base class IS the Claude Code wire behavior (Codex's PreToolUse contract is
character-identical, and several others are near-identical), so most adapters
override only what genuinely differs. The contract (implementation plan §2.1):

    normalize_input(raw)   stdin JSON -> claude-shaped payload (the core's
                           internal vocabulary: Bash / Write / Edit / MultiEdit /
                           PrebuiltDiff + claude-shaped tool_input fields)
    native_option(name)    host-native config lookup (env injected by the host's
                           plugin system), or None
    emit_deny / emit_ask / emit_allow / emit_allow_advisory
                           final wire output + exit. Receives FINAL strings —
                           version stamping etc. is composed by gate_lib BEFORE
                           delegation, so adapters stay dependency-free.
    capabilities           dict of static facts the core may consult

Hard invariants every adapter MUST keep:
  - fail OPEN: any internal error ends in exit(0) allow, never a stuck agent.
  - the deny reason must REACH THE MODEL (that is the entire product — a block
    without routing text is a wall, not a router).
  - never print secrets.

NOTE: adapters must not import gate_lib (gate_lib imports host — keep the
dependency one-way).
